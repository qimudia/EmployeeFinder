# Employee Finder - Node and Express Servers

This activity is to build a compatibility-based "EmployeeFinder" application. 
This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 
This survey has 10 questions. 
Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
The survey post to the localhost:3000/api/employees.
I wasnâ€™t able to compare two users at first but i am still working on it.
